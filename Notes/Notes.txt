2) SPRING OVERVIEW -
    Why Spring          -   EJB were complex with poor performance, Hence J2EE without EJB was required
                            1993-2001   EJB were popular
                            2004-2016   Spring was popular
                            2016-Now    J2EE(Java EE) and Spring are popular. Learn both
                            2017        Spring-5 released, Minimum Java 8 required
                                        Spring-6 released, Minimum Java 17 required
                                        Removed some old support
                                        Servlet API 4.0, Spring WebFlux added

    Goals of Spring     -   Lightweight development with POJO(Plain Old Java Objects)
                            Dependency Injection to promote loose coupling
                            Declarative Programming with AOP(Aspect-Oriented-Programming)
                            Minimize Java Code
    
3) SETTING ENVIRONMENT -
    Softwares           -   JDK 
                            Java App Sever (Tomcat) -   http://tomcat.apache.org
                            IDE (Eclipse)
